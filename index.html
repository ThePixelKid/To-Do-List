      <h2>Executive summary</h2>
      <p>There are substantial advantages offered by computers and other technology but environmental and health effects are evident throughout the lifecycle of the product: extraction, manufacture, use and disposal. This site will provide a summary of the concerns and practical activities that you can undertake, as well as government/community-to-promote-better-practices programs.</p>
    </article>

    <article id="issues" class="card">
      <h2>Main environmental issues</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Resource extraction:</strong> Metallic (cobalt, lithium, rare earths) mining is a disaster to natural ecosystems and people.</li>
        <li><strong>Production:</strong> Intensive energy consumption and water consumption, chemicals and industrial wastes.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy consumption:</strong> Devices and data centres use the electricity and cause greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
        <li><strong>E-waste:</strong> Incremental product development generates huge amounts of products that are difficult to handle and have toxic elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Design to become obsolete:</strong> Non repairable devices become more wasteful.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <article id="human-health" class="card">
      <h2>Impact of technology on human health</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exposure to toxins:</strong> non-formal e-waste recycling may release the heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants.</li>
        <li><strong>Occupational hazards:</strong> Mining and manufacturing employees can expose themselves to hazardous environments and chemical exposures.</li>
        <li><strong>Ergonomic problems:</strong> Musculoskeletal and eye strain problems are caused by poor work station set-ups and excessive screen time.</li>
        <li><strong>Mental health:</strong> Being always connected and facing a digital overload may bring stress and decrease the well-being.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <article id="what-you-can-do" class="card">
      <h2>What people are capable of doing now</h2>
      <h3>Reduce</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Only useful purchases should be made; non-power-consuming models should be used (ENERGY STAR, EPEAT).</li>
        <li>Reduce the number of unnecessary cloud or server resources; disable the idle VMs and services.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Reuse</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Repair and service devices (change battery, and/or add storage) to last longer.</li>
        <li>Give out working devices to the charities or the schools.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Recycle</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use certified recyclers (R2, e- Stewards ), or local municipal drop-off sites.</li>
        <li>Recycling printer cartridges in take-back programs.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Conserve energy & ergonomics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Turn on power savings options and turn off or disabilities monitors at each day.</li>
        <li>Adhere to the principles of ergonomics: watch on the eye level, adjust the chair height, set up the regular breaks.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <article id="initiatives" class="card">
      <h2>Community/ Government programs</h2>
      <p>The following are some of the activities that promote sustainability:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR):</strong> EPR is a set of laws or programs aiming at making companies fund the collection and recycling of electronics.</li>
        <li><strong>Government procurement:</strong> Purchasing policies in the government favor products which are energy efficient and those that are repairable.</li>
        <li><strong>Recycling facilities in the area:</strong> Municipal e-waste Drop and collection.</li>
        <li><strong>Refurbishment programs</strong> Nonprofits and social enterprises that recycle used equipment.</li>
        <li><strong>Campaigns and treaties:</strong> e.g. NGO pressure (e.g. greenpeace Detox) and international regulations (Basel Convention).</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <article id="strategies" class="card">
      <h2>Disaster mitigation plans (D1.1)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Extinguish:</strong> Forestall buying, select long lasting and effective merchandise.</li>
        <li><strong>Reuse/ refurbish:</strong> Subsidize the repair cafes and refuse devices donation.</li>
        <li><strong>Recycle correctly:</strong> Recyclers and the return-programs are certified.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy efficiency:</strong> Increase data centres efficiency, experience renewable energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Health and safety:</strong> Fullerton PPE, recycling facilities and standards.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <article id="implementation" class="card">
      <h2>Ideas of implementation in schools or small organisations</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Green procurement policy (indicate energy efficiency, and repairability).</li>
        <li>Design IT life cycle plan: inventory, maintenance, donation and recycling.</li>
        <li>Form joint ventures with local refurbishing or charities to have reuse programs.</li>
        <li>Conduct awareness programs and ergonomics.</li>
        <li>Measure results: electronic management of waste, longevity of device, use of energy.</li>
      </ol>
